Hair was done by Chloe.The service was exceptional. She was incredible thorough and helpful throughout the whole process. Even though it’s my first time colouring my hair.I had a cut after as well which went better than I imagined myself. Would definitely come back for my future haircut.
Came to Kolorist for the first time and left the place feeling super satisfied! I was attended by hair stylist En En and she did a really great job with my hair! The ambience was great and the service received was top notch. Will definitely recommend this place to all my friends. Thank you!
My first time trying out at Kolorist today. Hairstylist, Grace, is very soft spoken, gentle and nice. I did non-ammonia hair colour to cover grey hairs, keratin treatment. Results was good.
Hair stylist enen did my hair today with a great outlook! Came in with fizzy dry and messy hair. But look at the end result!! Satisfied!
Stylist en en was very honest with her professional opinions, as i shared what i had in mind. super pleasant experience, continuously explained the rationale and things she were doing which made me feel very assured and in good hands. prices were explained at the start and at the end, and was consistent as well with no surprises. very thankful for this experience, would definitely be coming back in the next few months and be recommending to my friends as well! thank u en en! 🙏🏻
The service at Cote Mi Nam was fantastic!!! Their stylists are all so nice especially shout out to Emil!! He did an amazing job on my hair and his service is so good! He was so patient in explaining every single detail, highly recommend his service!!
Had an amazing experience here! I did one tone hair colouring and hair cut, the process was very comfortable and enjoyable. my stylist Nikk (he is really nice, shoutout to him😜) was very cheerful and gave many suggestions on the hair colour which made me feel very reassured. I also shown him a reference photo for the haircut that i would like and he did a wonderful job on styling it :)
The service here is superb. I have my hair coloring done and Sawyer is nothing but passionate about sharing his expert advise and generous in applying the pre and post products on my hair to ensure that damage is minimized. And I walk out of the salon with a result that look exactly like picture. Will 100% come back and recommend others to come over and look for Sawyer too!
Haircut was done by Master Stylist Sawyer and hair colour by Vickie. Was a very comfortable experience, and they were very nice and accommodating to my needs as I have sensitive scalp.Thanks for the great experience, and would definitely come back again!
Sawyer did an amazing job coloring my dried up brassy balayage from a year ago. I also cut my hair myself and he was able to help tidy it up again. He is a great stylist and made me feel very relaxed and happy the final hair color.
Just dyed my hair here at Kolorist and it was an amazing experience!!! Hair was done by Mr. Sawyer and he was very patient in explaining what he was gonna do and ensured that I was clear of what will happen to my hair. Really great service, would definitely come back again!
The whole experience was really a pleasant one~

I had a perm before but I regretted it a lot because it was so curly. Hence, I didn't think about getting a perm again.But with Kolorist, their perm looks pretty and naturalwhich lasts for a long time so I'm visiting regularly! It's a complete recommendation!
I wasworried that my hair would be damaged but seems to have become better and I'm completely satisfiedbecause I don't have to straighten it every morning. The preparation time was shortened a lot.
I thinkmy hair got better because the designer carefully explained how to manage and care for my hair. And I tried a Korean-style perm for the first time and I like it moving forward. Satisfaction is 100% guaranteed!
Theservice of the designer was so good. Thank you for the tips on making your perm last longer. It was very helpful because there was not much damage after the perm. I will visit again!!!
